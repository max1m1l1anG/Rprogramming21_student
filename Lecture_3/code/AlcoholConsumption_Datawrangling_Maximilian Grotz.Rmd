# Import libraries and data


```{r cars}
library(readxl)
library(tidyverse)
library(ggrepel)

AlcConsum <- read_excel("../sourcedata/OECD-Health-Statistics-2020-Frequently-Requested-Data.xls", 
    sheet = "Alcohol consumption", na = "..", 
    n_max = 41, skip = 3)
colnames(AlcConsum)[1] = "countries"




```

## Graph for overview

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
ggplot() +
  geom_line(data = OECD_Health_Statistics_2020_Frequently_Requested_Data, aes(x = ))


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
