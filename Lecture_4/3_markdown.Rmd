In this notebook we will exercise using Markdown to format our documents.

## What is markdown

In Markdown you can just create plain text, but you can also do some formatting. That's what this lesson is about.

*Remember you can google everything*

A good ["cheat sheet can be found here"](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/rmarkdown-2.0.pdf)


## Formatting

For starters, it is possible to simply type text.

## Structure

But it is also possible to add structure to the text:

```
# Chapter
## Section
### Subsection
#### etc
##### etc
```

# Chapter
## Section
### Subsection
#### etc
##### etc

<br>

### Lists

```
* unordered list 
* item 2
  + sub-item 1
  + sub-item 2
  
1. ordered list
2. item 2
  + sub-item 1
  + sub-item 2
```

**Exercise**:

Now try to make a list of main points (1,2,3) and sub-points (3a, 3b) and knit to see the result.

1. Main point 1
2. Second main point
3. Third main point
    a. First sub point
    b. Second sub point

### Text formatting

**Exercise**:

Make one word in this sentence **bold**.


### Tables

```
First name | Surname |
----------- | ------------ |
Gertjan | Verhoeven |
Misja | Mikkers |
```

**Exercise**:

a. Copy this table
b. Add a line with your own name
c. Add a column with the title `Role` and fill in the roles after the names (valid roles are teacher, student, or teaching assistant)

First name | Surname | Role |
----------- | ------------ | ------------ |
Gertjan | Verhoeven |Teacher |
Misja | Mikkers |Teaching assistant |
Maximilian | Grotz | Student |

## Hyperlinks and images


### Hyperlinks


**Exercise**:

Insert a hyperlink to the [Tilburg University website](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/)

```
Insert a hyperlink to the [Tilburg University website](https://www.tilburguniversity.edu/)
```


### Pictures


**Exercise**:

Insert the photo of Donald Knuth, the inventor of a predecessor of R Notebooks. The photo is in the images folder.

![Donald Knuth](~/BSc Economics - TiU/Semester 2/Programming in R and Python/Assignments/R/Programming21_student_V2/Rprogramming21_student/Lecture_4/images/knuth.jpeg)

### Formulas

Write this image as an inline formula:

![](images/formula.png)
```
$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
```

### Starting a new page

You can force a pagebreak (new page) using this command.
This only works when you convert to PDF.
